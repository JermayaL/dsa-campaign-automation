<strong>DSA campaign converts search term data to dedicated campaign</strong>
Are you looking to optimize your Google Ads campaigns and boost your ROI? This script converts Dynamic Search Ads (DSA) campaign search terms into a Top Performer campaign with exact-match keywords.

To streamline this process, I have developed a Google Ads script that automates the conversion of DSA campaign search terms into a dedicated Top Performer campaign. This script will help you better control your advertising efforts, enhance your targeting precision, and maximize your campaign performance.

Key Features:

Monthly Conversion: This script can be scheduled to run weekly, ensuring that your DSA campaign's top-performing search terms are consistently extracted and transferred to a dedicated campaign.

Exact-Match Keywords: The script creates new ad groups with exact-match keywords based on the top-performing search terms from your DSA campaign. This precision improves ad relevance and can lead to higher click-through rates (CTR).

Ad Group Structuring: Each search term is matched with its corresponding ad group, providing a structured and organized setup for your Top Performer campaign.

Ad Copy Template: You can specify an ad copy template for your new ad groups, ensuring consistent and on-brand messaging. This makes it easy to maintain your ad creatives across multiple ad groups.

How It Works:
<ol>
<li>The script starts by identifying the top-performing search terms within your DSA campaign based on metrics such as clicks, conversions, or revenue. You can customize the criteria for defining "top performers."</li>
<li>Once the top-performing search terms are identified, the script creates new ad groups within your Top Performer campaign, each with an exact-match keyword.</li>
<li>For ad copy, the script utilizes your provided ad copy template (template) to create ads for each ad group. This maintains brand consistency and ensures your messaging aligns with your marketing goals.</li>
<li>The script then moves the chosen search terms from your DSA campaign to the respective ad groups in the Top Performer campaign.</li>
<li>Finally, you can set up a schedule for the script to run automatically each month, keeping your campaigns up to date and consistently optimized.</li>
</ol>
